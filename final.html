<h1>How to build a gaming computer</h1>

<h5>Welcome to the ultimate gaming computer building guide. This guide will walk you through determining your budget, picking your parts (depending on your use), and assembling the build!</h5>

<p>Building a gaming PC can be scary and daunting, however after
<br />finishing this guide you will become an expert gaming computer 
<br />builder. There are many advantages of building a gaming computer
<br />rather than using a console such as, tons of exclusives,
<br />cheaper games, and no fee for online services etc. The first
<br />step to building any gaming rig is deciding what your budget is
<br />going to be (how much youre willing to spend). This varies depending
<br />on what games you're planning to play, for example, someone who is
<br />only going to play competive esport type games such as CS:GO might
<br />not need a graphics card or might want to buy a cheap one. However
<br />someone who is planning on playing graphically intensive games
<br />such as the Witcher 3 might want to buy an expensive high-end 
<br />graphics card. While determining your budget, you might want to
<br />consider the cost of other items such as the price of a monitor,
<br />windows, keyboard and mouse , and any other accessories you may
<br />need, as these might take a large portion of your budget. Once
<br />you're done detrmining your budget, you can move on to picking your
<br />parts!</p>
