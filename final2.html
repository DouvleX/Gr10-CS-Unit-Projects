<h1>Building your PC</h1>

<p>You finally made it this far! After snagging the hottest
deals on multiple parts, making sure that all of your
parts are compatible and, picking your graphics card
after many days of contemplation, you finally get to
build it! After your parts come in you want to unbox
all of them, and then set them down gently on a surface
that doesnt conduct electricty (plastic/wood table), so
that your parts dont get a short circuit and end up
DOA (especially with motherboards). After that I recommend
watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lrdDID3i7s">this video by Austin Evans</a> to guide you through
building it as a visual aid is much more useful than me
explaining it.</p>

<h3>Installing windows and setting up:</h3>

<p>You're now so close to finally starting your amazing gaming
<br />experiance on PC. However, after getting your PC to boot,
<br />you need to immediatly get some things out of the way. These
<br />things include installing windows, and updating drivers. To
<br />do these somewhat challenging tasks I recommend watching
<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbpqkiaO7q4">this video by paul's hardware</a>. The only things you'll need
<br />to download windows are a USB 3 flash drive and a windows 10
<br />license. You can buy a license from pretty much any big box
<br />retailer or online, however I personally recommend using Kinguin
<br />as they sell legit license for only $30. However some people have
<br />had complaints with this website so if you want to make sure
<br />you don't get scammed, you can buy a lisence from Micrsoft
<br />however it is very pricy. After downloading windows you can
<br />finally download your favorite game launcher (steam,origin etc.)
<br />and game away!
